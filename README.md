# arma3_utils
This is based on the amazing work by Freddo3000 done in this: https://gist.github.com/Freddo3000/a5cd0494f649db75e43611122c9c3f15, and is supposed to make handling mods on dedicated arma3 servers a bit easier. 
By default it is set up to work with lgsm default paths, but if you know your basic paths, it should be able to serve any arma3 linux server.

Restarts are dependent on having an lgsm binary, I don't feel like fiddling with all the ways this could work if you don't use lgsm.
If you run a webserver on your arma3 server it also provides a way to automatically link your modlist to a folder for your players to get it.

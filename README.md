# arma3_utils
This is based on the amazing work by Freddo3000 done in this: https://gist.github.com/Freddo3000/a5cd0494f649db75e43611122c9c3f15, and is supposed to make handling mods on dedicated arma3 servers a bit easier. 
By default it is set up to work with lgsm default paths, but if you know your basic paths, it should be able to serve any arma3 linux server.
